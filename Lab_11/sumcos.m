function [ t, xx ] = sumcos( f, Z, fs, dur )
%SUMCOS Function to synthesize a sum of cosine waves
%usage:
%  xx  = sumcos(f, Z, fs, dur)
%  f   = vector of frequencies
%        (these could be negative or positive)
%  Z   = vector of complex exponentials Amp*e^(j*phase)
%  fs  = the sampling rate in Hz
%  dur = total time duration of signal
% 
%  Note: f and Z must be the same length
%        Z(1) corresponds to frequency f(1)
%        Z(2) corresponds to frequency f(2), etc.

t = [0:1/fs:dur];
xx = real(Z*exp(j*2*pi*f(:)*t(:)'));
